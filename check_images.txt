Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: No, Vgg is  the best and Resnet comes second and Alexnet has the less accuracy.
each model has its own architecture, algorithm and loss functions so some algorithms will be more accruate and there will be always limit for the accuracy.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: Yes,there is a big difference between both pictures so the classifer would easily identify it, the accuracy will be less when the two objects (dogs) are similar and we can higher the accuracy by training the classifer on more labels and data. 


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: VGG comes first, then Alexnet, and lastly RestNet.
